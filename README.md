# OOPS-examples
In this repo, I'll put all interesting classes examples in python. Hope this is helpful in understanding the concept of OOPS &amp; python syntax

Why Object Oriented Programming?
Creating objects allows us to organize related data and functionalies together. 
This helps us to write structured and flexible code. Instead of thinking about individual data and functions, we could think of objects and how these onjects interacts with one another. Divide a problem into smaller problems and reusable and define multiple objects with similar attributes and functionalities from a single class. This is a more practical way of solving real life problems.


Everything in python is an object of some class. We can build our own classes to build custom objects.
