Classes can have more than one parent(super class)

Child classes get all properties and attributes of parent classes.

Example:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name=name
        self.age=age
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + 'barks all the time'

class Gold(Dog):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name,age)
    
    def bark(self):
        return self.name + ' barks all the time'



class Puggy(Dog):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name,age)
        # self.height = height
    
    def caring(self):
        return 'It is very caring'


class Nike(Puggy, Gold):
    def __init__(self, name, age, height=1):
        super().__init__(name,age)
        self.height = height
    
    def roar(self):
        self.name + ' roars'


Nike class gets data from both Puggy and Gold. Both are subclasses, if Dog had to be mentioned, there was no necissity in providing all of them.

nike = Nike('nike', 3, 10)
print(nike.name)
print(nike.roar())
print(nike.caring())
print(nike.height)
print(nike.bark())
Output:
nike
None
It is very caring
10
nike barks all the time
